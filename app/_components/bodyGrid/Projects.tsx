          Social Media website done as a school project. It consists of 2
          versions, the first had basic implementations and the second version
          has more advanced features. Since it was for school I was forced to
          use <b>React</b> without <b>typescript</b> and <b>tailwind</b>.

          I have built this project while I was working for Niza Global. I used{" "}
          <b>React JS</b> combined with <b>tailwind</b> as a styling library. I
          have also used translations to make the website language selectable.
          Considering the large amount of content it had, the company website
          performed well.
