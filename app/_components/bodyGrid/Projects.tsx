          Social Media website done as a school project. It consists of 2
          versions, the first had basic implementations and the second version
          has more advanced features. Since it was for school I was forced to
          use <b>React</b> without <b>typescript</b> and <b>tailwind</b>.

          I have built this project while I was working for Niza Global. I used{" "}
          <b>React JS</b> combined with <b>tailwind</b> as a styling library. I
          have also used translations to make the website language selectable.
          Considering the large amount of content it had, the company website
          performed well.

          This website was done before some years, still when <b>Next JS</b>{" "}
          was not as popular as today. I used a <b>CMS</b> to handle the matches
          that my hometown used to play.
